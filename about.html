    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        I am an American born Asian. I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. Throughout my life, I have lived in the Bronx but the way I act doesn't really show that I live in the Bronx. I have many things that I like to do. Some of them are playing basketball, swimming, and playing video games.
